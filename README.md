# About
The Chalkboard library is a JavaScript namespace that provides a plethora of both practical and abstract mathematical functionalities for its user. It was developed by [Zushah](https://www.github.com/Zushah) during 2022 and 2023 and then [released](https://github.com/Zushah/Chalkboard/releases/tag/v1.0.0) on November 6, 2023. As per the latest release of [v1.5.0](https://www.github.com/Zushah/Chalkboard/releases/tag/v1.5.0), Chalkboard has 431 different commands. The library is available for regular JavaScript on both the client-side and the server-side as well as [Proccesing.js](https://www.processing.org/) (fully compatible with [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/chalkboard/6708642430369792)). Chalkboard's website can be visited [here](https://zushah.github.io/Chalkboard/home.html).

# Installation
If your JavaScript project is being run on the client-side within a webpage, you can install Chalkboard with this HTML tag:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Zushah/Chalkboard@1.5.0/src/Chalkboard.min.js"></script>
```
If your JavaScript project is being run on the server-side within the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) environment, you can install Chalkboard with this console command:
```bash
npm install @zushah/chalkboard@1.5.0
```
Alternatively, you can simply download the [latest release](https://www.github.com/Zushah/Chalkboard/releases/tag/v1.5.0) and put the relevant files in your project's directory.

More methods and details about installing Chalkboard can be read [here](https://zushah.github.io/Chalkboard/installation.html).

# Documentation
These are all thirteen Chalkboard categories with a brief description of what they're mostly about, and listed in the order they appear in the source code:
- `numb` - Number-theory-related operations
- `real` - Real number and real function operations
- `comp` - Complex number and complex function operations
- `quat` - Quaternion operations
- `plot` - Plotting functions, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and statistical graphs
- `geom` - Geometric formulae operations
- `trig` - Trigonometric function operations
- `stat` - Statistical array operations
- `vec2` - Two-dimensional vector operations
- `vec3` - Three-dimensional vector operations
- `vec4` - Four-dimensional vector operations
- `matr` - Multidimensional matrix operations
- `calc` - Several-variable calculus operations

There are also four "global" commands in Chalkboard, which are:
- `README()` - Prints basic information about Chalkboard in the console
- `LOGO()` - Draws the Chalkboard logo
- `PI()` - Computes the number pi
- `E()` - Computes the number e

The comprehensive Chalkboard documentation can be visited [here](https://zushah.github.io/Chalkboard/documentation.html).

# Getting Started
After installing Chalkboard into your program, you can immediately get started with using it. Every Chalkboard command begins with typing "Chalkboard" followed by a period, then the name of the category of the command (all categories are listed above in the [documentation](#documentation) section) with another period, and lastly the desired command itself.
```js
Chalkboard.category.command(parameters);
```
Here is some code that shows off only a few features of Chalkboard:
```js
const cb = Chalkboard; // Chalkboard is a nice name but it's also long
/*
Note that this code is written on the client-side
You can write all the same code on the server-side, too, but you would have to replace the line above with:
const cb = require("@zushah/chalkboard@1.5.0");
*/

let f = cb.real.function("Math.cos(2 * x)"); // f(x) = cos(2x)
let dfdx = cb.calc.dfdx(f, 2); // Derivative of f at x = 0
let fxdx = cb.calc.fxdx(f, 0, 2); // Antiderivative of f from x = 0 to x = 2
let fourier = cb.calc.Fourier(f, 2); // Fourier transform of f at x = 2

let f = cb.vec3.field("x", "y", "z"); // f(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)
let r = cb.real.function(["Math.cos(s) * Math.cos(t)", "Math.sin(s) * Math.cos(t)", "Math.sin(t)"], "surf"); // r(s, t) = (cos(s)cos(t), sin(s)cos(t), sin(t))
let fnds = cb.calc.fnds(f, r, cb.PI(-1/2), cb.PI(1/2), 0, cb.PI(2)); // Flux of the radial vector field through the unit sphere

let primes = cb.numb.primeArr(0, 100); // Array of prime numbers between 0 and 100
let midPrime = cb.stat.median(primes); // Median number in the primes array
cb.plot.barplot(primes, cb.stat.array(0, 100, 11), 5, [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 255]]); // Barplot of the primes array with a bin size of 10, a scale of 2, a stroke color of black, and a fill color of blue

let z = cb.comp.new(1, 1); // z = 1 + i
let zsqsqrt = cb.comp.sqrt(cb.comp.sq(z)); // The square root of z squared equals z
let f = cb.comp.function("a*a - b*b + 1", "2*a*b"); // f(z) = z^2 + 1 for z = a + bi (a complex-valued function)
cb.plot.function(f); // Plots the domain coloring of f

let r = cb.real.function(["Math.cos(t)", "Math.sin(t)"], "curv"); // r(t) = (cos(t), sin(t))
cb.plot.xyplane(2); // Draws the Cartesian coordinate plane
cb.plot.function(r, 2, [255, 0, 0] [0, cb.PI(1/2)]); // Plots r(t) colored red from t = 0 to t = Ï€/2

let a = cb.vec3.new(1, 2, 3); // Vector a = (1, 2, 3)
let b = cb.vec3.new(4, 5, 6); // Vector b = (4, 5, 6)
let c = cb.vec3.new(7, 8, 9); // Vector c = (7, 8, 9)
let axbxc = cb.vec3.vectorTriple(a, b, c); // Triple cross product between a, b, and c
cb.vec3.print(axbxc); // Prints axbxc in the console

let m = cb.matr.new([0, 1, 1, 1, 1],  // m is a 5x5 matrix
                    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
                    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
                    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
                    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]);
let mi = cb.matr.invert(m); // mi is the inverse of m
let mmi = cb.matr.mul(m, mi); // mmi is the product of m and mi
cb.matr.print(mmi); // Prints mmi in the console
```
